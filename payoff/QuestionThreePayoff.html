  If your signal of {{ signal }} was the highest, the lottery would be, on average, worth
  <span class="credits">C</span>{{ cworth }}.
</p>

  Given your signal being highest, you estimated the lottery to be, on average, worth between {{updated_min_worth}}
  and {{updated_max_worth}}. Your best guess was {{updated_worth}}.
</p>
<p>Your earnings for this round are <span class="credits">C</span>{{earnings_3b}}.</p>

<p>
  The correct estimate {% if guess_within_chosen_interval %} was {% else %} was not {% endif %} within your
  chosen interval, therefore you get {{earnings_3b}} credits.

<p>
  Given your best guess the probability of getting <span class="credits">C</span>12 was {{prob}}%. To compute your payoff the computer
  used a random device with this probability and you get <span class="credits">C</span>{{earnings_3a}}.
