  <h4>Your Answer</h4>
  <p>
    Given your signal being highest, you estimated the lottery to be, on average, worth between <span class="credits">C</span>{{updated_min_worth}}
    and <span class="credits">C</span>{{updated_max_worth}}. Your best guess was <span class="credits">C</span>{{updated_worth}}.
  </p>
 <h4>Correct Answer</h4>
  <p>
    If your signal of {{ signal }} was the highest, the lottery would be, on average, worth
    <span class="credits">C</span>{{ cworth }}.
  </p>

  <h4>Your Earnings</h4>
  <p>Your earnings for this round are <span class="credits">C</span>{{earnings_q3}}.</p>

  <h4>Details</h4>
  <p>
    {% if guess_within_chosen_interval %}
      {% if computed_value_non_zero %}
        The actual lottery worth was within your chosen interval, and given your interval's width you get <span class="credits">C</span>{{earnings_3b}}.
      {% else %}
        The actual lottery was within your chosen interval, but your interval was too wide. Therefore, you get <span class="credits">C</span>{{earnings_3b}}.
      {% endif %}
    {% else %}
      The actual lottery worth was not within your chosen interval, therefore you get <span class="credits">C</span>{{earnings_3b}}.
    {% endif %}
  </p>
  <p>
    Given your best guess the probability of getting <span class="credits">C</span>12 was {{prob}}%. To compute your payoff the computer
    used a random device with this probability and you get <span class="credits">C</span>{{earnings_3a}}.
  </p>
  <p>In total, you get <span class="credits">C</span>{{earnings_q3}}.</p>
