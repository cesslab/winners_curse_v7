  <h4>Your Answer</h4>
  <p>
    Given your signal being highest, you estimated the lottery to be, on average, worth between {{updated_min_worth}}
    and {{updated_max_worth}}. Your best guess was {{updated_worth}}.
  </p>
 <h4>Correct Answer</h4>
  <p>
    If your signal of {{ signal }} was the highest, the lottery would be, on average, worth
    <span class="credits">C</span>{{ cworth }}.
  </p>

  <h4>Your Earnings</h4>
  <p>Your earnings for this round are <span class="credits">C</span>{{earnings_q3}}.</p>

  <h4>Details</h4>
  <p>
    The actual lottery worth {% if guess_within_chosen_interval %} was {% else %} was not {% endif %} within your chosen
    interval, therefore you get {{earnings_3b}}.
  </p>
  <p>
    Given your best guess the probability of getting <span class="credits">C</span>12 was {{prob}}%. To compute your payoff the computer
    used a random device with this probability and you get <span class="credits">C</span>{{earnings_3a}}.
  </p>
  <p>In total, you get <span class="credits">C</span>{{earnings_q3}}.</p>
