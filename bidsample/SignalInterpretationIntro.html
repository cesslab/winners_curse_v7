<p>A signal of {{ player.signal }} means that the {{ player.selected_value_text }}
  lies between {{ player.min_signal }} and {{ player.max_signal }} inclusively,
  where every integer between {{ player.min_signal }} and {{ player.max_signal }} is equally likely to
  be the {{ player.selected_value_text }}. To help you interpret the signal better, we will always display next to your
  signal the range of possible {{ player.selected_value_text }} given your signal.</p>
