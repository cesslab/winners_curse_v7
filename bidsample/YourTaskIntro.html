<p>In every round you will answer questions about three different features of a lottery. There is a right answer to each
question. The closer your answer is to the correct one, the more you will earn. For each feature you may earn a maximum
of 24 credits. For all questions, the best you can do is to always state what you truly believe is the best answer.</p>
<p>At the end of the experiment we will randomly choose one question for payment and only then you will learn how close
you answer was to the correct answer for that particular question.</p>
