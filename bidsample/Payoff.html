      After you have completed all 40 rounds in Part One, the computer will randomly select one out of the 40 auctions,
      with each auction being equally likely to be selected. Your earnings from the selected auction will correspond to
      your payoff in Part One. You should therefore in each of the 40 auctions choose your bid carefully as if it were
      the one that will determine your payoff.
