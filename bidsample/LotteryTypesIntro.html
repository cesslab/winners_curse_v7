<p>There will be four different types of lotteries where a lottery type is defined by a {{ player.selected_value_text }} and a
  probability of receiving that {{ player.selected_value_text }}. For each type of lottery, the computer will produce
  independently from each other 10 different lottery tickets and in each round you will bid for one of them. Moving
  from round to round will involve a change in the {{ player.selected_value_text }} holding the range of possible
  {{ player.selected_value_text }}s and the probability fixed, while a new type of lottery may involve a change in
  both the range of {{ player.selected_value_text }}s and the probability.
