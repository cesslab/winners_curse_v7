    There will be four different types of lotteries where a lottery type is defined by a range of possible {{ player.selected_value_text }}s and a
    probability of receiving a {{ player.selected_value_text }}.

    For each type of lottery, the computer will produce
    independently from each other 10 different lottery tickets and in each round you will bid for one of them. Moving
    from round to round will involve a change in the {{ player.selected_value_text }} holding the range of possible
    {{ player.selected_value_text }}s and the probability fixed, while a new type of lottery may involve a change in
    both the range of {{ player.selected_value_text }}s and the probability.
