  <div>
    <p>
      Whether or not you obtain the lottery ticket depends on how your bid compares to the other three bids. Thus, every auction has three possible outcomes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>You win the auction: </b>
          If your bid is higher than the bids of the three
          other participants, you will win the auction, pay your bid and receive
          the lottery ticket. The computer will then execute the lottery. The
          outcome of the lottery will be either the
          {% if player.is_value_treatment %} Selected Value {% else %} value {% endif %}
          (<span><span class="credits">C</span></span>) or zero, and you will receive the difference between the outcome
          and your bid (i.e., your earnings = lottery outcome - your bid).
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that if you win and bid more than the
          {% if player.is_value_treatment %} Selected Value {% else %} value {% endif %}
          or you win and the outcome turns out to be zero, you will lose money in a given auction.
          We will provide you with an endowment of credits to absorb the losses you make. However, if you do not incur
          a loss the endowment is yours to keep so incurring a loss means you will decrease what you earn in the
          auction when it is over.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>You lose the auction: </b>
          If at least one other bid is higher than yours, you will lose the auction and get nothing.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>There is a tie: </b>
          If you and another bidder submit identical highest bids, the computer will determine the winner with equal chances.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      At the end of the auction, you will learn the {% if player.is_value_treatment %} Selected Value {% else %} Selected Probability {% endif %},
      the winning bid, the outcome of the lottery and your earnings in this auction.
    </p>
  </div>
