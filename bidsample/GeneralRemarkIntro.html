<p>In every auction, you and each of the other three bidders will independently
  from each other receive a signal surrounding the same {{ player.selected_value_text }}. The
  four of you might therefore receive different signals. Yet, no one will see the
  signals of the other three bidders. Thus, the four of you will face the same
  lottery ticket, but the signal-updated range for the
  {{ player.selected_value_text }} may be different.</p>
