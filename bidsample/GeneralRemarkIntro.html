<p>In every auction, you and each of the other three bidders will  independently receive a signal surrounding the <b>same</b>
  {{ player.selected_value_text }}. The four of you might therefore receive different signals but they will all be
  centered around the same {{ player.selected_value_text }}.
  Yet, no one will see the signals of the other three bidders. Thus, the four of you will face the same
  lottery ticket, but the signal-updated range for the
  {{ player.selected_value_text }} may be different.</p>
