<h3>Part I</h3>
<p>
  Part I has 12 rounds. In each round, you will see a lottery ticket. Any lottery is characterized by two features:
</p>

<ol type="1">
  <li>A {% if player.is_value_treatment %}Selected {% endif %}Value (in <span class="credits">C</span> ): a non-zero amount of credits that the lottery possibly pays off and,</li>
  <li>A {% if player.is_value_treatment %}probability{% else %}Selected Probability{% endif %} (in %): the probability of receiving the non-zero amount of credits.</li>
</ol>
<p>For instance, consider the following lottery ticket:</p>

{% include 'bidsample/SampleLottery.html' %}

<div>
  <p>
    In this example,
    <span class="credits">C</span>{% if player.is_value_treatment%}20 {%else%}70 {%endif%}
    is the {% if player.is_value_treatment%} Selected Value {%else%} value {%endif%} and
    {% if player.is_value_treatment%} 70% {%else%} 20% {%endif%} is the
    {% if player.is_value_treatment %} probability {% else %} Selected Probability {% endif %}.
    This means that this lottery pays <span class="credits">C</span>{% if player.is_value_treatment%}20 {%else%}70 {%endif%}
    with a {% if player.is_value_treatment %} 70% {% else %} 20% {%endif%} chance and pays
    <span class="credits">C</span>0 with an {% if player.is_value_treatment %} 30% {% else %} 80% {% endif %} chance.
    The outcome of this lottery is then either
    <span class="credits">C</span>{% if player.is_value_treatment%}20 {%else%}70 {%endif%} or
    <span class="credits">C</span>0.
  </p>
</div>
