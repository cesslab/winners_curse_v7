<p>
 There will be four different types of lotteries where a lottery type is defined by a {{ player.selected_value_text }}
  and a probability of receiving that {{ player.selected_value_text }}. For each type of lottery, the computer will
  produce independently of each other 3 different lottery tickets and in each round you will see one of them.
  Moving from round to round will involve a change in the Selected Value holding the range of possible
  {{ player.selected_values_text }} and the probability fixed, while a new type of lottery may involve a change in
  both the range of {{ player.selected_values_text }} and the probability.
