  There will be four different types of lotteries where a lottery type is defined by a Selected Value and a
  probability of receiving that Selected Value. For each type of lottery, the computer will produce independently
  from each other 3 different lottery tickets and in each round you will see one of them. Moving from round to round
  will involve a change in the Selected Value holding the range of possible Selected Values and the probability fixed,
  while a new type of lottery may involve a change in both the range of Selected Values and the probability.
