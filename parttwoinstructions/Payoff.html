    <p>
      After you have completed all 40 rounds in Part II, the computer will randomly select one out of the 40 auctions,
      with each auction being equally likely to be selected. Your earnings from the selected auction will correspond
      to your payoff in Part II. You should therefore in each of the 40 auctions choose your bid carefully as if it
      were the one that will determine your payoff.
