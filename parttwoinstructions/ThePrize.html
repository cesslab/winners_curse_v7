In every round a prize will be auctioned off. The prize will be a lottery ticket like the ones you have seen in Part I.
Like in Part I, in each round you will again see lotteries with an unknown {{ player.selected_values_text }}, about which you will receive
a signal. Remember that the Selected Value is no more than x numbers away from your signal.
