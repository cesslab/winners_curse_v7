<p>
  Independently from each other, the other three bidders have also received a signal surrounding the same
  {{ player.selected_value_text }}. The four of you might have received different signals. That means, the four of you
  face the same lottery ticket, but the signal-updated range for the {{ player.selected_value_text }} may be different.
  Yet, no one will see the signals of the other three bidders.
