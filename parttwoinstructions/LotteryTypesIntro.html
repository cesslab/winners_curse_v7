 There will be again four different types of lotteries. For each type of lottery, the computer will
  produce independently of each other 10 different lottery tickets and in each round you will see one of them.
  Moving from round to round will involve a change in the {{ player.selected_values_text }} holding the range of possible
  {{ player.selected_values_text }} and the value fixed, while a new type of lottery may involve a change in
  both the range of {{ player.selected_values_text }} and the value.
