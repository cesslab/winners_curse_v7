          <h4>Interval Selection</h4>
          <p>
            Now choose an interval that contains the worth of the lottery with a 50% probability; that is,
            you should be 50% sure that the interval contains the lotteryâ€™s true worth. The smaller your chosen
            interval is, the more you will earn, but you will only earn a payoff if the actual worth of the lottery
            lies within your chosen interval.

          <div><p>The graphs show the trade-off between making your interval wider but not too wide.
            Increasing the width of the interval increases the chances to capture the true worth of the lottery and to
            get a payoff (top graph), but at the same time it decreases your payoff (middle graph).
            The overall effect on your expected payment depends on the actual lottery and your chosen width (bottom graph).
            Eventually, choosing an interval that is too wide, may decrease your average payment.</p></div>
