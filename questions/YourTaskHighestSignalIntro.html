  Guess the lotteryâ€™s worth if you have the highest signal. You will earn <span class="credits">C</span>12 if your best guess is sufficiently
  close to the correct estimate according to the laws of probability theory; and nothing if it is too far away.
  How close your guess is to the correct estimate regulates your chance of getting <span class="credits">C</span>12: The further away your
  guess is from the actual worth of the lottery, the lower is the probability that you get <span class="credits">C</span>12.

  It can be shown that the best you can do is to state what you truly believe the answer to be.
