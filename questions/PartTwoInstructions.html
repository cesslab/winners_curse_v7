<h3>Part II</h3>

<h4>General Information</h4>
<p>
  Part II has 12 rounds (3 rounds for each of the four types of lotteries). Like in Part I, in each round you will again see lotteries with
  an unknown {{ player.selected_value_text }}, about which you will receive a signal.
  Remember that the {{ player.selected_value_text }} is no more than x = {{player.epsilon}} numbers away from your signal.
</p>
<p>
  Again, you will be randomly matched with three other participants from previous experiments. Remember that independently
  from each other the other three bidders also have received a signal surrounding the same {{ player.selected_value_text }}.
  The four of you might therefore receive different signals. That means, the four of you face the same lottery ticket,
  but the signal-updated range for the {{ player.selected_value_text }} may be different.
</p>
<p>
  In every round you will answer questions about three different objects of an auction. There is a right answer to each
  question. The closer your answer is to the correct one, the more you will earn. For each object you may earn a maximum
  of 24 credits. For all questions, the best you can do is to always state what you truly believe is the best answer.
<p>
  In this part you will not learn anything at the end of the round. At the end of the experiment we will randomly choose one
  question for payment and only then you will learn how close your answer was to the correct answer for that particular
  question.
