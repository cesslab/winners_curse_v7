  While before we asked you to report what you thought the worth of the lottery was, we now ask you to choose the
  <b>smallest</b> interval for which you are certain that it contains the worth of the lottery. The formula we use to
  calculate your payoff has the following property: The smaller your chosen interval is, the more you will earn,
  but you will only earn a payoff if the actual worth of the lottery lies within your chosen interval.
  The maximum you can earn by selecting an appropriate interval is <span class="credits">C</span>12.
