  The lottery is worth what you get, on average, if you play the lottery very often. The correct answer to that
  question depends on the probability and the true {{ player.selected_value_text }} of the lottery ticket. Also, remember that four
  signals about the {{ player.selected_value_text }} will be drawn and you will be shown one of them. The lottery pays either the
  {{ player.selected_value_text }} or nothing. Therefore, the lottery cannot be worth less than zero or more than the {{ player.selected_value_text }}.
