  The lottery is worth what you get, on average, if you play the lottery very often. The correct answer to that question
  depends on the probability and the true {{ player.selected_value_text }} of the lottery ticket. Keep in mind that the lottery pays either
  the {{ player.selected_value_text }} or nothing. Therefore, the lottery cannot be worth less than zero or more than the {{ player.selected_value_text }}.
