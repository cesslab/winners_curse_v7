<p>
  The lottery is worth what you get, on average, if you play the lottery very often. The correct answer to that question
  depends on the {% if player.is_value_treatment %} probability {% else %} value {% endif %} and the true
  {{ player.selected_value_text }} of the lottery ticket. Keep in mind that the lottery pays either
  the {% if player.is_value_treatment %} Selected Value {% else %} value {% endif %} or nothing.
  Therefore, the lottery cannot be worth less than zero or more than the
  {% if player.is_value_treatment %} Selected Value {% else %} value{% endif %}.
