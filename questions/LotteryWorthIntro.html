<p>
  The lottery is worth what you get, on average, if you play the lottery very often. The correct answer to that question
  depends on the probability and the true Selected Value of the lottery ticket. Also, remember that four signals about
  the Selected Value will be drawn and you will be shown one of them. The lottery pays either the Selected Value or
  nothing. Therefore, the lottery cannot be worth less than zero or more than the Selected Value.
