<p>
  While above we asked you to choose an interval that contains the worth of the lottery,
  we are now interested in knowing how confident you are that that interval actually contains the lotteryâ€™s worth.
  To do that we are asking you to choose a number between 0% and 100% to describe your confidence.
  The number 100% means that you are 100% sure that the lottery worth is in your chosen interval, while 0% means there
  is no chance that the lottery worth is within your chosen interval. (Obviously, in the latter case,
  you may want to choose a different interval.)
