<p>For example, if you choose a narrow interval from 1 to 2, and the actual lottery worth is indeed between 1 and 2,
then you would get <span class="credits">C</span>11 (this may slightly vary with the type of lottery).
Alternatively, if you choose a wider interval from 72 to 92, and the actual lottery worth is indeed between 72 and 92,
then your earnings would be only <span class="credits">C</span>2 since, despite the fact that the worth was within the
interval you chose, the interval was wide and hence you earned less.

  If the lottery worth is outside your chosen interval you will get nothing.
