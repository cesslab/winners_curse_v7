  Now choose the smallest interval for which you are certain that it contains the estimated worth of the lottery if you
  had the highest signal. Just as before, the smaller your chosen interval is, the more you will earn
  (with a maximum of <span class="credits">C</span>12), but you will only earn a payoff if the correct estimate lies
  within your chosen interval.
