  In this question we are asking you to estimate the probability that the signal you saw is the highest of four
  independently drawn signals. To do this choose a number between 0% and 100%. Your answer will determine the
  probability that you will get a fixed payoff of <span class="credits">C</span>24. You increase your chance of getting
  <span class="credits">C</span>24, 1) the closer your number is to 100%, and you are indeed seeing the highest signal,
  or 2) the closer your number is to 0%, and you are NOT seeing the highest signal. The best you can do is to report
  your true belief about the probability.
