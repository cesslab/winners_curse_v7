<h5>
  How likely is it that you have the highest signal?
</h5>
<p>
  In this question we are asking you to estimate the probability that the signal you received is the highest of four
  independently drawn signals. To do this choose a number between 0% and 100%. Your answer will determine the
  probability that you will get a fixed payoff of <span class="credits">C</span>24. You increase your chance of getting
  <span class="credits">C</span>24, 1) the closer your number is to 100% and your signal is indeed the highest
  one, or 2) the closer your number is to 0% and your signal is NOT the highest one. The best you can do is to report
  your true belief about the probability.
