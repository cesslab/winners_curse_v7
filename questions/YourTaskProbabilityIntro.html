  In this question we are asking you to estimate the probability that the signal you received is the highest of four
  independently drawn signals. To do this choose a number between 0% and 100%. Your answer will determine the
  probability that you will get a fixed payoff of <span class="credits">C</span>24. You increase your chance of getting
  <span class="credits">C</span>24, 1) the closer your number is to 100% and your signal is indeed the highest
  one, or 2) the closer your number is to 0% and your signal is NOT the highest one. The best you can do is to report
  your true belief about the probability.
</p>
<p>
For example, if you state 92% and you have indeed the highest signal, then the difference to the correct answer 100% is
  only 8 percentage points and according to the formula we use to determine your payoff, you will get
  <span class="credits">C</span>24 with a probability of 99.36%.
</p>
<p>
  However, if you state 92% and you do not have the highest signal, then the difference to the correct answer 0% is
  92 percentage points then, according to the formula we use to determine your payoffs, you will get<br>
  <span class="credits">C</span>24 with a probability of only 15.36%.
