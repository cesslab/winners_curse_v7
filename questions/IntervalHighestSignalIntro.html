  Now choose an interval that you think will contain the estimated worth of the lottery if you had the highest signal.
  Just as before, the smaller your chosen interval is, the more you will earn, but you will only earn a payoff if the
  actual worth of the lottery lies within your chosen interval.

  For example, if you choose a narrow interval from 1 to 2, and the correct estimate is indeed between 1 and 2,
  then you would get <span class="credits">C</span>11 (this may slightly vary with the type of lottery).
  Alternatively, if you choose a wider interval from 72 to 92, and the correct estimate is indeed between 72 and 92,
  then your earnings would be <span class="credits">C</span>2.
</p>
<p>
  If the correct estimate is outside your chosen interval you will get nothing.
