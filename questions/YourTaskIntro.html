  Guess the worth of the lottery. You will earn <span class="credits">C</span>12 if your guess is sufficiently close to
    the actual worth of the lottery; and nothing if it is too far away. How close your guess is to the actual
    worth regulates your chance of getting <span class="credits">C</span>12: The further away your guess is from the
  actual worth of the lottery, the lower is the probability that you get <span class="credits">C</span>12.

  It can be shown that the best you can do is to state what you truly believe the answer to be.
