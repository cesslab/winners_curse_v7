  For example, given the payoff formula we use, if you choose a narrow interval from 1 to 2, and the correct estimate is
  indeed between 1 and 2, then you would get <span class="credits">C</span>11 (this may slightly vary with the type
  of lottery).

<p>
  Alternatively, if you choose a wider interval from 72 to 92, and the correct estimate is indeed between 72 and 92,
  then your earnings would be <span class="credits">C</span>2.
</p>
<p>
  If the correct estimate is outside your chosen interval you will get nothing.
