  Choose a number between 0% and 100%. The number 100% means that you are 100% sure that the correct estimate is in your
  chosen interval, while 0% means there is no chance that the correct estimate is within your chosen interval.
  (Obviously, in the latter case, you may want to choose a different interval.)
